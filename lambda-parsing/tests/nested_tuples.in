// A nested tuple is created and then deconstructed using a nested pattern.
let test1 = (
  let nested = <1, <2, 3>, 4> in
  let <x, <y, z>, w> = nested in
  x + y + z + w // Should be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
) in

// A function that accepts an empty tuple (like a unit type) is defined and called.
let test2 = (
  let get_unit_val = fun <> -> 42 in
  get_unit_val <> // Should be 42
) in

// This verifies that pattern matching on an empty tuple works correctly.
let test3 = (

) in

let test4 = <> in

// The expected final result is <10, 42, 2025, <>>.
